## VisionGuard Store: Pricing and Navigation Fixes Complete

Successfully identified and resolved two critical issues with the VisionGuard e-commerce store:

### Issues Resolved:
1. **Price Display Error**: Updated banner from incorrect "$29.99" to correct "$39.99" to match actual product pricing
2. **Navigation Malfunction**: Fixed header navigation links that only worked on homepage but failed on product pages

### Technical Implementation:
- **HomePage.tsx**: Updated price display and added hash-based navigation handling with useLocation hook
- **Header.tsx**: Converted navigation buttons to React Router Link components with hash-based URLs (/#section format)
- **Navigation Architecture**: Implemented cross-page navigation that works from any page in the store

### Testing and Verification:
Comprehensive testing confirmed both fixes working correctly:
- ✅ Price banner displays accurate $39.99 pricing
- ✅ All 7 navigation elements (Home, Products, Benefits, Reviews, Contact, Cart, Logo) function properly from any page
- ✅ Smooth automatic scrolling to homepage sections when navigating from other pages

### Deployment:
- Successfully built and deployed updated store
- New URL: https://nafex38sshi3.space.minimax.io
- All functionality verified through automated testing

The VisionGuard store now provides seamless navigation across all pages with accurate pricing information, significantly improving the user experience for potential customers browsing the blue light glasses collection.
