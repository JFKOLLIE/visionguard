{"extracted_information": "The 'State of the Consumer 2025' report reveals that crisis-era consumer habits have persisted, leading to a permanent shift in behavior. Despite global consumer sentiment being poorer than in early 2020 due to inflation concerns, spending continues, and the link between sentiment and spending has weakened. Consumers prioritize value and convenience, often making unexpected cross-category trade-offs. The old frameworks for understanding consumer behavior no longer apply, as adaptations from the COVID-19 pandemic have solidified into lasting changes.\n\n**Key Behavioral Forces Shaping the Sector (US Focus):**\n1.  **Increased Alone Time & Digital Engagement:** US consumers are spending more time alone and online. Free time has increased, with a significant portion dedicated to solo activities like hobbies, independent relaxation, shopping, fitness, and social media. E-commerce and food delivery services are highly adopted. This trend is driven by a 'bring-it-to-me' mindset, reshaping retail, dining, and grocery delivery, with expectations for speed, low cost, reliability, and easy returns constantly rising.\n2.  **Digital Channels' Influence (Despite Trust Issues):** While social media is the least trusted source for buying decisions in the US and Europe, interactions with friends and family (most trusted sources) occur there. Digital platforms, including social media, significantly influence purchase journeys and brand perceptions. Social media use for product research has increased, and a notable percentage of US consumers have purchased brands discovered via social media.\n3.  **Gen Z as a Dominant Segment:** Gen Z (born 1996-2010) is projected to be the largest and wealthiest generation. Their experiences have shaped their values, leading them to prioritize financial security (career success, wealth creation) over traditional life stage milestones. Despite financial worries and smaller savings, US Gen Zers are prone to spending, splurging, and taking on debt, often paying a premium for convenience, including delivery services. They are setting future consumer expectations.\n4.  **Preference for Local:** Consumers, particularly in the US and Canada, show a growing preference for buying local brands, primarily to support domestic businesses. This trend means multinational companies face a higher bar and must tailor offerings to local tastes and source locally where possible.\n5.  **New Approaches to Value:** Rising prices remain the top concern. Consumers are actively 'trading down' (seeking deals on every purchase, delaying purchases) but also engaging in 'cross-category trade-downs' (cutting back in one area to splurge in another, even non-discretionary to discretionary). Despite financial concerns, many still plan to splurge. Discount and wholesale channels continue to attract consumers across demographics.", "specifications": {"survey_methodology": {"mckinsey_consumerwise_sentiment_survey": {"fielding_dates": "April 26 to
