{"extracted_information": "The WEB CONTENT contains significant statistics and insights regarding consumer willingness to wait for sustainable shipping and eco-friendly delivery. A March 2023 survey of 500 consumers by Sifted found that 79.6% would wait at least one day for sustainable shipping. This willingness decreases with longer wait times: 45% would wait at least two days, and 15.6% would wait three days or more. The study also reveals that 69% of consumers reported that sustainable shipping influenced their past purchases, and 76% are willing to pay an extra 5% for more sustainable shipping. While sustainability is important, price remains a primary consideration, with inflation cited as a reason for its increased priority. The importance of sustainable packaging and shipping when purchasing online decreased from 66% in 2021 to 56.8% in 2023. Additionally, consumers are aware of packaging's impact: 76.6% believe companies use excessive packaging, 72% say the amount of packaging has a moderate to high environmental impact, and 70.4% say the type of packaging has a moderate to high environmental impact.", "specifications": {}, "pricing": {"willingness_to_pay_extra": {"percentage": "76%", "amount": "5%", "for_what": "more sustainable shipping"}}, "features": [], "statistics": {"willingness_to_wait_for_sustainable_shipping": {"at_least_one_day": "79.6%", "at_least_two_days": "45%", "three_days_or_more": "15.6%"}, "influence_on_past_purchases": {"percentage": "69%", "factor": "sustainable shipping"}, "importance_of_sustainable_packaging_and_shipping": {"2023_total_important": "56.8% (33.8% important, 23% very important)", "2021_total_important": "66% (32.6% important, 33.4% very important)"}, "consumer_perception_on_packaging": {"companies_use_excessive_packaging": "76.6%", "amount_of_packaging_impact_on_environmental_sustainability": {"moderate_to_high_impact": "72%"}, "type_of_packaging_impact_on_environmental_sustainability": {"moderate_to_high_impact": "70.4%"}}}, "temporal_info": {"survey_date": "March 2023", "data_comparison_years": ["2021", "2023"]}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": [{"source": "Sifted (logistics software vendor)", "type": "survey", "sample_size": "500 consumers"}, {"source": "Digital Commerce 360", "url": "https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2023/05/04/80-of-shoppers-will-wait-for-sustainable-shipping/"}, {"source": "Caleb Nelson", "title": "Chief Growth Officer at Sifted", "url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/caleb-nelson-443f"}]}
